# Retail-Business-Performance-Profitability-Analysis
README - Retail Transactions Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project analyzes a cleaned retail transactions dataset to derive insights related to product performance, customer behavior, profitability, and inventory management.
Dataset Description
The dataset contains retail transactions including customer purchases, product details, pricing, profit margins, discounts, seasons, store locations, and payment methods.
Key Activities Performed
- Loaded and reviewed Cleaned_Retail_Transactions.csv
- Generated SQL queries for sales, profit, seasonal, and regional analysis
- Created Python visualizations to understand inventory days vs profit
- Analyzed product category distributions
- Derived actionable suggestions for slow-moving and overstocked items
Power BI Dashboard
Built visuals such as:
- Total Sales, Profit, and Transactions (KPI cards)
- Sales trend over time (line chart)
- Top products by profit (bar chart)
- Seasonal performance (column chart)
- Payment methods (pie chart)
- Store performance and state-wise sales (map or bar chart)
Strategic Insights
Based on the analysis:
- Overstocked items reduce profitability
- Certain product categories are underperforming
- Inventory rotation can be optimized with KPIs and visual tracking
- Repeat customers contribute to higher lifetime value
Recommendations
- Mark slow-moving SKUs for promotion or clearance
- Reduce reorder volume for underperforming categories
- Use InventoryDays metrics in future dashboards
- Combine sales and inventory KPIs for better demand forecasting
Deliverables
- SQL queries
- Power BI visuals and insights
- PPT summary on inventory strategy
- Python visualizations
- README file (this document)
